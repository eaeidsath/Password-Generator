## Usage

To view this webpage, enter the URL [https://eaeidsath.github.io/Password-Generator/](https://eaeidsath.github.io/Password-Generator/) into any browser.

To use the password generator, click the 'Generate Password" button.

When the prompt appears, type in the desired length of your password between 8 and 128 characters.

The following 4 prompts will ask whether you want your password to include lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters. On these prompts, click "Ok" to include the corresponding character type, or "Cancel" to not include the character type. You must select "Ok" to at least one of the character types in order to successfully generate a password.

Once the prompts have been answered, the randomly generated password will appear in the text box.

Copy the text in the box and paste it wherever you want to use your new password.

If you enter a password length outside the bounds of 8-128, or if you do not select "Ok" to any of the character type prompts, you will be given an error message followed by prompt asking if you want to start over. Click "Ok" on this prompt to start the generation process again, or click "Cancel" to exit the prompt without generating a password.
